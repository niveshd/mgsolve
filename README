Run the program using following command. 3 represents No of levels. 10 is no. of v cycle iterations

	./mgsolve 3 10

compile the program like this. All the necessary object files are automatically compiled. Read Makefile
	
	make

Every time program is run, appropriate data is appended to solution.txt, step_size_vs_error.txt, step_size_vs_time.txt

	./mgsolve 3 10
	./mgsolve 4 10
	./mgsolve 5 10

solution.txt has data in the following format. Note that the current solution.txt contains the data as per the graph in pdf, once you re-run the mgsolve, this solution.txt would be deleted and a new version with latest values will be created.

	(x coordinate) (y coordinate) (function value)

step_size_vs_error.txt has data in the following format

	(step_size) (error)

step_size_vs_time.txt has data in the following format

	(step_size) (time)
	
For ploting the 2-D graph using GNUplot, use the following command:
		gnuplot
		set grid3d 65, 65 // (65 is based on number of levels (2^n + 1), this command has been written for n = 6)
		set hidden3d
		splot "solution.txt" u 1:2:3 w lines

otherwise, use the following command
		plot "filename.txt" u 1:2 w lines
